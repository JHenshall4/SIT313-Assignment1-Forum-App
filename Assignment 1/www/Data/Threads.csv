How I made my bedside table,Dummy Data,19/06/2005,Hey everyone - Today I wanted to share how I made my bedside table! This was a very long and interesting project for me as it's my first DIY - but I managed to pull it off and I'd like to share how I did it! -- Unfortunately - because this forum isn't yet compliant with the use of commas and line breaks the formatting will look a little funny! For this project I used: 1x Log - 1x Glue - 4x Nails. I just hit them all together and made a table! WOW!,Very impressive stuff there Dummy! I too cannot wait for this forum to be improved - spectacular work!,Have you considered using paint on this project?,Pictures would be nice,Wow! I just did something like this the other day - I pretty much used the same materials as you and followed this cool guide I found at https://www.dummysitethisisnotreal.com - I really encourage you guys to check em out! ,,,,,,
